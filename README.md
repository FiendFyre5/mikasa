### Python Setup

It is recommended that you use a python virtual environment, so developers can stay on the same python version and handle pip packages easily.

Make sure you have the latest `python` or `python3` package installed. `python2` will not work.
* `cd` into the main directory of the project
* Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
* To activate venv: `source venv/bin/activate`
* To deactivate venv: `deactivate`


To install all the modules, you will need pip. Then, downloading them is easy: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
